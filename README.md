**Background 1  : Art & Craft in Odisha**
•	Odisha was known as Utkala during ancient and medieval times. Utkala the name itself means – the land of excellence in art and craft. The art forms are visual manifestations of the rich cultural heritage of Odisha and reflect a tradition that still lives in the creative imagination and skill of her craftsmen.
•	Diverse, vibrant, and utilitarian the art and craft of Odisha range from —stonework, silver filigree, woodcraft, appliqué work, brass and bell metal work, dhokra castings, horn work, pattachitra, paper mache, terracotta, tie & dye textile in cotton,tassar and silk to name a few. Stemming from centuries of exquisite craftsmanship, they are a colorful testimony to the integral life force of the people of the state.
•	Lots of research happened to date.
•	 Lots of papers published by now.
•	 Lots of initiatives taken by the Government and other entities.
•	 
But it’s still dying. 
•	Artists and Craftsmen still not getting enough to build up a better living for themselves. 
•	Giving a good education to their kids.
•	Not able to substantiate their belief in their long and inherited assets, the knowledge they have got from their parents, generation to generation.

Jagara, as the name suggests, it’s of Lord Jagannath!!! 
By using the new-age blockchain technology, one can digitalize real-world assets into tokens on the blockchain. 
1.	_Unlocking the value of physical assets as digital tokens_. By representing physical assets as digital tokens on a distributed digital ledger or blockchain, it’s possible to unlock the value of real-world assets and exchange them in real time in a more authentic way.
2.	_Accelerating the exchange of value using blockchain_. Today’s cross-border payment processes are fraught with time delays, complexity, and inefficiencies. Payments are the backbone of global commerce, but payment in real time has yet to be achieved. Whether it’s payments or other asset classes, the ability to move real-world assets onto a blockchain offers the advantages of a secure digital platform, while retaining the characteristics of the asset. 


**The digitization of real-world assets into tokens on the blockchain**
1. Unlocking the value of physical assets as digital tokens
•	Today, it takes one click to buy an airline ticket or a new sweater, but if you want to buy stocks or get a mortgage, transactions are more time intensive. Whether it’s waiting for documents or settlement, many types of transactions aren’t instant. Assets like gold, real estate, fine art, or carbon credits are more difficult to transfer, often obligating buyers and sellers to contend with mountains of paperwork and lengthy procedures. By representing physical assets as digital tokens on a distributed digital ledger or blockchain, it’s possible to unlock the value of real-world assets and exchange them in real time.

Whether it’s payments or other asset classes, the ability to move real-world assets onto a blockchain offers the advantages of a secure digital platform, while retaining the characteristics of the asset. Securitization is the process through which contractual obligations such as mortgages, car loans, personal debt, or receivables are pooled, and their cash flows are sold as standard units to investors.
•	Digitization of assets is a process in which the rights to an asset are converted into a digital token on a blockchain. Ownership rights are transmitted and traded on a digital platform, and the real-world assets on the blockchain are represented by digital tokens.

**What is the NFT Market place**
•	A non-Fungible Token or NFT marketplace is a marketplace that functions as a public Blockchain platform. However, this platform is gaining traction and driving developers and businesses to construct a marketplace, despite being in its nascent stage. 
•	Online marketplaces for digital assets are the recent talk of the fintech town. But, of course, you have to build your own marketplace if you are planning to set foot in the digital market. The words cryptocurrency trading and blockchain technology are no longer unknown, and many people trade goods on several marketplaces. 
•	Proponents of NFTs claim that NFTs provide a public certificate of authenticity or proof of ownership. The ownership of an NFT as defined by the blockchain has no inherent legal meaning and does not necessarily grant copyright, intellectual property rights, or other legal rights over its associated digital file. 
Conceptualizing NFT marketplace
•	It is a platform that makes it simple to store and sell NFTs. These tokens are generally available for purchase or auction at a set price. To use an NFT marketplace, you will need a crypto wallet to store and trade your best NFT tokens.
•	Users have to create an account, upload digital artwork, and sell their work on the marketplace. In general, specialized marketplaces are more popular than conventional ones because they include everything a client would require—specialized marketplaces’ expertise in promoting online artworks and concentrating on specific target audiences.

**Addressing Safety and Security**
•	RFID chips, barcodes, and QR codes are not suitable for securing physical assets in a tracking process, because they can be copied. Therefore, the counterfeiters could add a tracking feature to their fake products. The idea of tracking physical objects through PUFs is not new, but there is no concept of how this immutable property can be transferred to the digital layer. The blockchain is regarded as an unchangeable data structure due to the decentralized architecture, which is why we will examine how these technologies can be used to secure the distribution pathways of products.
•	The drying process results in cracks and patterns that are unique, their origin is chaotic and not predictable. The crack patterns are produced on different granularities in terms of crack size, depending on the varnish used. The resulting pattern can be read as a fingerprint for physical products. This means that each product can be uniquely identified. Some paints lead to fine cracks that can only be seen under a microscope. Other lacquer results in a rough crack pattern, which is already clearly visible in pictures taken with conventional mobile phone cameras.
•	These are particularly suitable for use in the supply chain, as these mobile devices are accessible to the mass market. The crack pattern of the varnish is unique if the product packaging or the product itself is provided with it.

**Software Solution – Jagara – Our own NFT marketplace**

•	Jagara will offer a marketplace allowing for non-fungible tokens to be sold directly at a fixed price, or through an auction, based on the Ethereum ERC-721 standard, the layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum Polygon, the KIP-7 standard for Klaytn, and the SPL standard for Solana.
•	Jagara is an online peer-to-peer marketplace where NFTs in the form of gaming items, digital art, and other goods can be bought and sold.
•	Users can create their own customizable marketplace using the Jagara software and set their own fees for their sales. Users can create auctions for items with any cryptocurrency of their choice. They must submit a contract on the platform to get their auction started. The application programming interface can show users market data with statistics and insights in the form of graphs so users can see how their digital assets are trending. Users can sell their assets in packs, airdrop rewards to customers if so desired, and create loot boxes.
•	Sales are conducted through smart contracts on the platform, and users can keep their commission after paying a fee to Jagara.


**Technical Approach**
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique, digital items with blockchain-managed ownership. As a marketplace for NFTs, Jagara will have below unique vantage point: 
•	Standardization: By representing non-fungible tokens on public blockchains, developers can build common, reusable, inheritable standards relevant to all non-fungible tokens. These include such basic primitives as ownership, transfer, and simple access control. Additional standards (specifications for how to display an NFT, for example) can be layered on top for rich display inside of applications.
•	Interoperability:  Non-fungible token standards allow non-fungible tokens to move easily across multiple ecosystems. This is possible because open standards provide a clear, consistent, reliable, and permissioned API for reading and writing data.
•	Tradeability: The most compelling feature enabled by interoperability is free trade on open marketplaces. For the first time, users can move items outside of their original environments and into a marketplace where they can take advantage of sophisticated trading capabilities.

•	Liquidity:  Instant traceability of non-fungible tokens will lead to higher liquidity. NFT marketplaces can cater to a variety of audiences—from hardcore traders to more novice players—allowing for greater exposure of the assets to a wider pool of buyers.
•	Immutability and provable scarcity: Smart contracts allow developers to place hard caps on the supply of non-fungible tokens and enforce persistent properties that cannot be modified after the NFTs are issued. Developers can also enforce that specific property do not change over time by encoding them on-chain. This is particularly interesting for art, which relies heavily on the provable scarcity of an original piece.
•	Programmability: Of course, like traditional digital assets, NFTs are fully programmable.
